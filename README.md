# A personal dashboard app
This little app is for my personnal use. It has been made thanks to Django Framework and does not need any model to work.
The app front-end is based on Bootstrap. 

You can use it to monitor cryptocurrencies news and markets, movies and tv shows.

This software uses the followin APIs:
* Weather API [Here](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* Movie and TV Shows API [Here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/)
* Crypto Currencies Coin Market API [Here](https://coinmarketcap.com/fr/api/)
* Quotes API [Here](https://theysaidso.com/api/)
* News API [Here](https://newsapi.org)
