# A personal dashboard app
This little app is for my personnal use. It has been made thanks to Django Framework and does not need any model to work.

This software is only using API:
* Weather API [here](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* Movie and TV Shows API [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/)
* Crypto Currencies Coin Market API [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/fr/api/)
* Quotes API [here](https://theysaidso.com/api/)
* News API [here](https://newsapi.org)
